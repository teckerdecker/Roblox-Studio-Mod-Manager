This program is a custom launcher for Roblox Studio which allows you to maintain custom files in Roblox Studio 
without Roblox overwriting them everytime you launch.

(HEADS UP: I haven't setup a certificate for this program yet, so Windows Smartscreen might complain when you try to run this. Just ignore the warning, and you'll be able to use the program. Sorry for the inconvinience)
